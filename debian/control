Description: Orocos Bayesian Filtering Library
      Orocos (http://www.orocos.org) is the acronym of the
      Open Robot Control Software project. The project's aim is to develop
      a general-purpose, free software, and modular framework
      for robot and machine control.
      The Orocos project supports 4 C++ libraries: the Real-Time Toolkit, the
      Kinematics and Dynamics Library, the Bayesian Filtering Library and
      the Orocos Component Library.
      .
      This package provides the BFL library.
